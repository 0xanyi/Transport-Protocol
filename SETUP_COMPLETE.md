## üöÄ How to Test Your New Features

### Test 1: Add Vehicle with Photos
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/vehicles
2. Click **"Add Vehicle"**
3. Fill in vehicle details:
   - Make: Toyota
   - Model: Camry
   - Registration: TEST123
   - Pickup Location: Heathrow Airport
   - Pickup Date: Today
   - Mileage: 25000
   - Fuel Gauge: 75%
4. **Upload Pickup Photos**: Try uploading 2-3 test images
5. Click **"Add Vehicle"**

**Expected Result**: Vehicle created with photos visible in the list

### Test 2: View Photos
1. Find your test vehicle in the list
2. Look for the camera icon showing photo count
3. Click **"View"** button
4. **Expected Result**: Modal opens showing pickup photos

### Test 3: Process Vehicle Return
1. Find a vehicle with "Available for assignment" status
2. Click **"Process Return"**
3. Fill in return details:
   - Return Mileage: Higher than pickup
   - Fuel Gauge: Any percentage
   - Notes: "Test return process"
4. **Upload Return Photos**: Add different photos
5. Click **"Process Vehicle Return"**

**Expected Result**: Vehicle status changes to "RETURNED"

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### If Photo Upload Doesn't Work
1. **Check Browser Console** (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. **Look for error messages** related to upload
3. **Verify R2 credentials** in `.env.local`
4. **Test with smaller images** (under 5MB)

### If Images Don't Display
1. **Check Public URL** is correct
2. **Verify bucket permissions** in Cloudflare
3. **Check browser network tab** for failed image requests

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Upload not available" message | Check R2 environment variables are uncommented |
| Upload fails with 403 error | Verify R2 API token permissions |
| Images upload but don't display | Check public URL configuration |
| Slow uploads | Images are uploaded directly to Cloudflare (fast) |
