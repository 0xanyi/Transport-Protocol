-- Fix infinite recursion in users table policies
-- Drop existing policies that cause recursion

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own data" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all users" ON users;

-- Create simpler policies that don't cause recursion
-- For now, we'll allow broader access since our API handles authorization

-- Policy 1: Allow reading user data (for login purposes)
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access for authentication" ON users 
FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Policy 2: Allow API to manage users (since we have API-level authorization)
CREATE POLICY "Allow API access" ON users 
FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Alternative: If you want to disable RLS for users table entirely
-- (since we're handling authorization at the API level):
-- ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify policies
